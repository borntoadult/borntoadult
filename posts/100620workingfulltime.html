              Just over 8 months ago I started my first full time job. Find out how it's going, the reasonable adjustments I was able to get and applying to Access to Work.

              So I started my first full time job just over 8 months ago - what exactly do I do? Well, I test websites and mobile apps to assess their accessibility and I prepare and provide training to clients to help them understand and implement accessibility in their digital products.
            </p>
            <p>
              The organisation I work for is amazing with reasonable adjustments. I am under no illusion that if they were not so flexible I would not be working. They supported me all through the application process, adjusting the tasks to allow me to shine. They have allowed me to work from home, which means that I can control my environment and focus solely on my work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before I started, I was encouraged to apply to Access to Work (AtW). This is a system similar to the Disabled Students Allowance (DSA), which helps employees to gain access to services, equipment or assistive technology that can help them to work effectively and helps to even out some of the disadvantages you face as a disabled person in the workplace. My access to Work assessment occurred just before I started and helped me to identify some assistance and adjustments that can help me to perform my best at work.

            <p>
              I am being supported very well by my line manager who is happy to support me and answer all the questions I can come up with - I am one of those people who asks every question under the sun so I know what to do, where to go and what is happening.
